        No one could possibly mistake “Tenet” as being by anyone but Christopher Nolan. First, it has the kind of budget that only Nolan could get for an original screenplay. There’s so much money in every bursting frame of this opulent film that a scene in which gold
         bars are literally dumped on a runway feels almost like a self-referential wink. Second, it contains one of those time-twisting narratives that have defined the Nolan brand, one that blends robust action sequences with high-concept stories that viewers have to legitimately
         strain to follow. Finally, at times, it even seems
         to echo previous Nolan projects like an album of remastered greatest hits. There are war action scenes that recall “Dunkirk,” an espionage narrative that feels like “Inception,” and even a whole lot of people talking through masks a la Bane in “The Dark Knight Rises.” It is 100% designed as an
         experience for people who have unpacked films like “The Prestige” and “Memento” late into the night, hoping to give Nolan fans more to chew on than ever before. More certainly seems to be the operating principle of “Tenet,” even if the chewing can get exhausting.
        <br>
        [Note: Spoilers will be incredibly light but if you want to go in completely unvarnished as many Nolan fans do, you’ve been warned.]

“Tenet” wastes no time, dropping viewers 
into an attack on a symphony performance in Kiev and barely allowing anyone to get oriented. One of the agents sent in to retrieve a high-profile asset during the assault is a man known only as The Protagonist (John David Washington, proving 
more than capable of carrying a blockbuster film with his charismatic performance). Our hero is captured by the enemy, tortured, and takes a cyanide capsule, as he was ordered to do in training. He survives, and his allegiance to the system and his orders leads to a
 promotion of sorts, a top-secret assignment that involves a new technology that has the potential to literally rewrite human history.
<br>The Protagonist is taken to a remote facility
 and introduced to the concept of inverted objects. We look at an object and it is traveling forward through time along with us. That’s obvious from elementary school science class. But what if an object could go in the other direction through history instead? Apparently, objects have been 
 doing exactly this, and the Powers That Be need to control it because if a bullet could be sent back through time,
  what happens if a nuclear weapon takes the same trip?

Teaming up with a mysterious partner 
named Neil (a charming Robert Pattinson), our hero tracks inverted objects to a villainous Russian arms dealer named Andrei (Kenneth Branagh). To get closer to this mega-wealthy madman, The Protagonist uses Andrei’s wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki), who loathes her abusive husband but is being blackmailed into staying with him via threats that she will lose
 her son if she doesn’t do exactly what he says. On a very basic level, “Tenet” is about the extremes of unmonitored power. When one becomes so rich and powerful that they can literally shape world events, why not try to shape world history too? Sound a little familiar? Andrei is very much cut from the same cloth as classic Bond
  villains, complete with unchecked opulence, Russian accent and snarling 
line delivery. Blend Nolan’s obsession with time-twisting high concepts and his love of classic action construction and you have some idea what “Tenet” feels like.

        Stamped with the sort of aggressive mediocrity that has come to define Shawn Levy’s glorified IP creation farm 21 Laps, Free Guy is a dispassionate 
        science-fiction film that almost dupes you into thinking that it is clever. It really isn’t.

Although it could be, provided you’ve never seen a movie before, or if you’re just learning about Ryan Reynolds’ 
strategically-curated charm, or maybe if you’ve recently recovered from a serious illness and are happy to 
just be alive. But let’s be honest; none of this is very likely. Which brings us
 back to square one: Free Guy is rather forgettable.
<br>
Done well, nothing is more fun than a big, dumb Hollywood movie. We had one just a few months ago; 
it was called The Tomorrow War, and starred another white movie star desperate for mass-affection. And while that 
film, like Free Guy, could seem heavily derivative
occasion, it borrowed mainly the tone and
 plot mechanics of 90s blockbusters. Free Guy, on the other hand, deals almost exclusively in superficial references.

But that’s what one can expect from Levy, who has spent the last few years overseeing Netflix’s Stranger Things, a derivative show if there ever was one.
 Free Guy in its opening scene comes across like the live-action remake of The Lego Movie, and gradually flicks elements from
 The Truman Show, The Matrix and even Ready Player One, which, in a classic example of Hollywood self-plagiarism, was co-written by Zak Penn,
  one of the co-writers of this film.
<br>Ryan Reynolds plays Guy, an NPC in an open-world video game who works at a bank and has been sentenced to living the same daily routine. A chance encounter 
with a mysterious woman gives him gives him an epiphany, and inspires Guy to become the 
hero of his own life story. High on free
 will, he befriends the mysterious woman and offers to help her in her quest to find proof against the game’s evil developer, Antwan, played by Taika Waititi.

Two things happen to Guy in quick succession. He learns that he has agency, and also realises that he is a mere construct leading a meaningless life that
 has been predetermined for him.
 This information, gained in such a short span of time, should’ve ideally broken his brain.
 But instead, Guy has a minor 
meltdown after which he decides to proceed with his original plan anyway.

    Back in the day, the two big counterculture sci-fi novels were the libertarian-division Stranger in a Strange
     Land by Robert Heinlein, which made the word “grok” a thing for many years (not so much anymore; hardly even pops up in crossword puzzles today) and Frank
      Herbert’s 1965 Dune, a futuristic geopolitical allegory that was anti-corporate, pro-eco-radicalism, and Islamophilic. Why mega-producers and mega-corporations
      have been pursuing the ideal film adaptation of this piece
      of intellectual property for so many decades is a
      question beyond the purview of this review, but it’s an interesting one.
    <br>
    As a pretentious teenager in the 1970s, I didn’t read much sci-fi, even countercultural sci-fi, so Dune missed me. When David Lynch’s 1984 film of the novel,
     backed by then mega-producer Dino De Laurentiis, came out I didn’t read it either. As a pretentious twentysomething film buff, not yet professional grade, the only thing 
    that mattered to me was that it was a Lynch picture. But for some reason—due diligence, or curiosity about 
    how my life might have been different had I gone with Herbert
     and Heinlein rather than Nabokov and Genet back in the day—I 
    read Herbert’s book recently. Yeah, the prose is clunky and the dialogue often clunkier, but I liked much of it, particularly the way it threaded its social commentary with enough
     scenes of action and cliff-hanging suspense to fill an old-time serial.

The new film adaptation of the book, directed by Denis Villeneuve from a script he wrote with Eric Roth and Jon Spaihts, visualizes those scenes magnificently. As many of you are aware, “Dune” is set in the very 
distant future, in which humanity has evolved in many scientific respects
 and mutated in a lot of spiritual ones. Wherever Earth was, the people in this scenario aren’t on it,
 and the imperial family of Atreides is, in a power play we don’t become entirely conversant with for a while,
 tasked with ruling the desert planet of Arrakis. Which yields something
 called “the spice”—that’s crude oil for you eco-allegorists in the audience—and presents multivalent perils for off-worlders (that’s Westerners for you geo-political allegorists in the audience).
<br>
To say I have not admired Villeneuve’s prior films is something of an understatement. But I can’t deny that he’s made a more-than-satisfactory movie of the book. Or, I should say, two-thirds of the book.

(The filmmaker says it’s half but I believe my estimate is correct.) The opening title calls it “Dune Part 1” and while this two-and-a-half hour movie provides a bonafide epic experience, it's not coy about connoting that there’s more to the story. Herbert’s own
 vision corresponds to Villeneuve’s own
 storytelling affinities to the extent that he apparently did not feel compelled to graft his own ideas to this work. And while Villeneuve has been and likely remains one of the most humorless filmmakers alive, the novel wasn’t a barrel of laughs either, and it’s salutary
  that Villeneuve honored the scant light notes in the script, which I suspect came from Roth.
